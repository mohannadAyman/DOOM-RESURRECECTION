# DOOM-RESURRECECTION
A Computer Graphics University Project, resurrecting the infamous "Doom" game, using "OpenGL", "GLFW" and C++.
The project aims to resurrect the old feeling of Doom 64, and imitate the way it was meant to play back then with the new technologies of nowdays.
The PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, BUT NEARLY MOST OF THE MAIN IDEAS ARE IMPLEMENTED.
